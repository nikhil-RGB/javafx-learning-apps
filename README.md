This repository is a set of all JAVAFX apps I'm building to learn the framework.<br>
I'm extrememly new to this GUI framework, but have previous experience with AWT/SWING app building <br>
in JAVA.<br>
Few to none of the apps here use the SceneBuilder tool for UI design.<br>
Releases will include stable releases of the apps I'm designing here.
